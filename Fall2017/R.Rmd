## Some R history

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) was developed in the late 1980s in New Zealand by [Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2012/06/the-influences-that-shaped-r-inferno-ish-r.html), known as `R & R`. It was built on LISP language ideas adopting the syntax of the `S` language, which was in turn created by John Chambers and colleagues at AT&T in the 1970s. While `S` was proprietary, limiting distribution, `R` has been freely available and open source since the beginning. Since the 1997, `R` has been maintained by a core development team of about 20 people. For more information, see <https://www.r-project.org/about.html>.

Originally, `R` ran on a "dumb" terminal. There were many efforts to build a useful graphical user interface, or GUI. [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com) was founded in 2008 with public release in 2011, and was quickly adopted by the `R` community. See <https://www.rstudio.com/about/>.

## Basics of RStudio

`RStudio` has four panes to organize the page:

1. Scripts (top-left)
2. R console (bottom-left)
3. Files/plots/help/etc (bottom-right)
4. Environment/history (top-right)

The R console is the basic "dumb" terminal for `R`, where you can type commands directly.

These panes can be rearranged if desired. There are shortcuts to focus on just one pane:
<kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Shift`</kbd> + <kbd>`2`</kbd>
focuses on the R console pane. Use <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> +
<kbd>`Shift`</kbd> + <kbd>`0`</kbd> to return to all four panes.

Each pane potentially has multiple tabs with useful information. For instance, pane 3 (bottom-right) has `Files`, `Plots`, `Help` and other tabs. Just click on one to bring it forward.

**Help** on commands can be found with the `Help` tab of pane 4, typing in `log` where the magnifying glass is. Alternatively, type on the `Console`, pane 2, either

```
help(log)
```

or

```
?log
```

to bring up the `log` help page. Another way to get help is to start typing a command and then pause. A yellow popup will appear with a condensed version of the help page.

## R project

It is useful to organize `R` work into projects. Click `File → New Project → Existing directory → Browse for folder`; find folder where you want to work; click `Open`. Then click `Create project`. You can also create a new directory if preferred.

The "working directory" is the folder where you do `R` work. You can use the command `getwd()` to find out what the working directory is. Here is a sample layout (from Data Carpentry lesson) with some suggested sub-folder names to further organize work:

## Scripts

Within your project, you can create or save files.
The top-right Source pane (1) is a place to build scripts, that is, flat files with commands and comments. [Comments begin with the sharp `#` character.] Click the green circle with plus at top left and click `R Script` to creat an `Untitled` script. Save this (Either `File → Save` or the floppy disk icon); you will be asked to supply a name, and prompted where you want to put it. At this point you can create a `New Folder` (bottom left of save popup) and name it `scripts` if you like.

The top-left pane (4) has a `History` tab that shows all commands you have typed. You can highlight lines and move them `To Source`.

Be sure to save your script file frequently.

## R Environment and Closing out RStudio

`R` works by creating local files in the `Environment` (see pane 4, top-right). These are local objects in your `R` workspace only present during your active session. They do not exist as files outside of `R`.

It is good practice to NOT save your workspace, but instead recreate your work from scripts every time. To enforce that use the menu: `Tools → Global Options ...` and set `Save workspace to .RData on exit` to <kbd>`never`</kbd>. Also, unclick the box for `Restore .RData into workspace at startup`. These force you to be explicit each time about what objects you are working with.

You exit from RStudio in the usual manner for apps on your system. For instance, click `RStudio` in upper right of top ribbon and then click `Quit RStudio`.

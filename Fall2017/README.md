# R Study Group Fall 2017

This sub-directory contains notes and code for R Study Group during Fall 2017 led by Brian Yandell. The bulk of material has been migrated to <https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences>
where it can be used for multiple purposes. This folder will be used for the navigation of that material, and any addition material that is pertinent to COMBEE but perhaps not a wider audience.

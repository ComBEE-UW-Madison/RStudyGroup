# R Study Group Fall 2017

This sub-directory contains notes and code for R Study Group during Fall 2017 led by Brian Yandell. The bulk of material has been migrated to <https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences>
where it can be used for multiple purposes. This folder will be used for the navigation of that material, and any addition material that is pertinent to COMBEE but perhaps not a wider audience.

## Fall 2017 Schedule: 

- September 28th: Curating Data Structures with tidyverse tools
- October 12th: Visualize Data in R (ggplot2, cowplot, heatmaps, etc.)
- October 26th: Organizing Data with databases and RMarkdown
- November 2nd: Profiling Code for Errors and Simulations
- November 23rd: THANKSGIVING - NO MEETING
- November 30th: Connecting Data Beyond R

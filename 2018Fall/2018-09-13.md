#### Questions
* Wat is even R?  
[Official answer](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#What-is-R_003f)

* Why is it called R?  
Trust me this is a little stupid. The name is partly based on the (first) names of the first two R authors (Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka), and partly a play on the name of the Bell Labs language 'S'. Personally, I think the play on the name of S is BS.

* What is the difference between R and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)?  
R is the programming language. RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. It has *lots* of built-in functions that make it easier to interact with your data and code while using R.

#### Bonus Questions
* Is there any actual useful information at this session?  
[Data Capentry Workshop for a good intro to R](https://uw-madison-aci.github.io/2017-08-22-uwmadison-dc/)

* Wat is markdown (what we're writing this in)?  
Lightweight formatting-friendly language.
[Here's a cheatsheet!](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

* Know any good R jokes?  
Hah! I thought you'd never ask...  
  * The worst thing about the R programming language is its name. For that there is [rseek.org](https://rseek.org). 
  * [The R Inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf) with gems such as _The author thanks D. Alighieri for useful comments._ in the footnotes of the first few pages.
  * [aRrgh: a newcomer's (angry) guide to R](http://arrgh.tim-smith.us)
